# Hi there 👋, I'm Aamir Khan!

## DevOps / Cloud Engineer | Automation Enthusiast 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Aamir Khan, a DevOps / Cloud Engineer with a strong passion for automation. I enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies and tools to streamline software development, deployment, and operations. 💻

### About Me

I have extensive experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud-based infrastructure solutions. My expertise lies in building scalable and resilient architectures using various cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I am proficient in creating and managing infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform and CloudFormation. ☁️

Automation is at the core of my work. I believe in the power of automation to increase efficiency, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall reliability of systems. I have hands-on experience with configuration management tools like Ansible and Chef, as well as containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. 🤖

I am a strong advocate for DevOps practices and strive to foster collaboration between development and operations teams. I am well-versed in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, leveraging tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS CodePipeline. 🌉
